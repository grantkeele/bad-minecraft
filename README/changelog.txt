July 2019
- Started development, created framework for blocks and very basic world generation
- Used my preexisting system for movement and looking around

August 2019
- Added better world generation using simplex noise, water at and below sea level
- Added trees and cacti
- Implemented four biomes with a simplex noise mapping system (desert, forest, hills, mountains)'
- Added the ability to place and destroy blocks
- Water is rendered differently so that other water blocks are invisible when next to it, but all other block are visible.
  Also applies a blue filter to screen when underwater 
- Added cave generation
- Added fog
- Added view reticle

September 2019
- Made it so the bottom layer of the world is lava
- New biome mapping algorithm; now uses Voronoi mapping to allocate polygonal biome areas which are randomly distributed
- Tweaked biome definition to include subsurface blocks
- Added ground cover/surface alteration to world generation
- Added new biomes (swamp, badlands, lush desert, plains)
- Added basic house generation, one per biome
- Added a new "delta map" that records where caves affect the surface of the world (makes it so ground cover and 
  houses are not floating and instead are placed where the caved-out ground is)
  
October 14, 2019
- Fixed missing code in house generation script
- Created this changelog

November 2, 2019
- Added cloud generation framework

November 16, 2019
- Added lava pit biome
- Added deep ocean biome
- Added Jungle Poison Biome
- Added new Biome property: liquidBlock
- Reintroduced fine scale noise to heightmap generation
- Tweaked biome noise values and heights
- Added underwater ground cover
- Added poison block
- Fixed transparent block behavior to allow for poison and lava to behave like water in terms of visibility
- Mountains now have 'snow' (cloud blocks for now) at high elevations
- When caves are generated, they no longer remove stone that is directly adjacent to liquid

November 23, 2019
- Added Pine and Ball-shaped trees
- Added a tree generation property that removes a percentage of leaves
- Added Green Mountains biome
- Biome List can be used to only generate wanted biomes, with choosable percentages of each biome

November 24, 2019
- Revamped Jungle Poison biome to have a lot more trees, which are both taller and more interesting
- Swamp biome trees are more interesting and swampy
- Added Island biome

November 27, 2019
- Added an actually good cloud system: uses 3d simplex noise to make a layer of clouds about 5 blocks thick, high in the air

December 7, 2019
- Added gravity!
- Added floor collision!
- Created more camera control functions: move with vector and move to position

December 8, 2019
- Began work on wall collision: collisions are detected, but handling does not work yet

December 14, 2019
- Changed floor detection to ignore liquid blocks
- Changed quarter-step algorithm to be n-step to allow more or less precise collision detection; gravity
  now uses 8th-steps to be more precise, and gravity's deltatime is maxed at 0.15 seconds so you don't
  clip through the floor at low frame rates
- Fixed wall collision by just lowering the player's speed and capping deltatime. Current system is not super efficient
  and also only works at low speeds, but for now it works.

December 15, 2019
- Block placement and removal no longer passes through other blocks, and also is more accurate

May 15, 2020
- Resumed work on Good Minecraft
- Tweaked ground cover for Forest, Jungle and Swamp biomes
- Added horizontal and vertical biome scaling option for world generation
- Added ceiling collision
- Changed 'poison' liquid to turquoise water

May 19, 2020
- Added sun angle feature, including a day/night cycle
- Added a light on the player
- Fixed lighting bug where light hitting the back side of polygons would subtract color instead of adding it
- Added rudimentary placeable light source
