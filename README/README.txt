To play Bad Minecraft(TM):

  - Download all files into a new folder of your choice.

  - Open Bad_Minecraft_APP.html IN CHROME to play (This html file is what actually displays the game).
  
  - Click anywhere on the screen to take control of the camera and move your mouse to look around.  Press escape to unhide the cursor.



CONTROLS:

  W - forward
  A - left
  S - backwards
  D - right

  Q - down
  E - up

  Left Mouse - break block
  Right Mouse - place block
  < and > - change block in hand



NOTES:

  - There are (currently) no physics working yet, so you just fly around and can go through blocks for now. However, you can break and destroy blocks however you want (except for water).

  - Performance is going to be pretty bad unless you have a super beefy CPU and lots of memory, since GPU isn't used in the rendering engine (you can tweak render settings to get better performance).

  - I get about 12-20 fps on default setting with my PC, and surprisingly it runs slightly better on school PCs (maybe my PC just sucks...)
  
  - There is a bug where if your camera goes right next to a face, it will sometimes freeze the whole tab for a long time or until it crashes. I think I know where the problem is happening but 
    I don't know how to fix it yet. Just don't get too close to faces for now.

  - Check out blockIDs.txt to see which block corresponds to each ID, and also the biome types and cool seeds because i don't know how to organize.

  - Hi Mr. Yang thank you for checking this out and writing a letter of recommendation I really appreciate it.



HOW TO CHANGE VARIABLES:

  - While the game is running, press F12 to open the Chrome console. Here you can modify the following variables to change render settings and performance:

    * renderDistance (default = 3)
    * drawFog (default = true)

  - The rest deal with the world generation, I'll eventually make a config file with everything in it so you can customize the world
